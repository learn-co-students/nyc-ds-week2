# Phase 1 Mini Project

This repo will be used for the remaining `Morning Exercises` of Phase 1. 

This week's lecture material focuses on data querying and data collection techniques. Each day of this week, we will use the skills learned from the previous day and add additional information to a dataset. At the end of the week we will have a customized dataset that can answer specific and interesting questions!
